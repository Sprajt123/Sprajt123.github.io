          <div><h2>Salle design</h2><h3>Salle impressed me with it creative and original design. Everything is centred which influenced me to the point to use this impression in my final design. I want my website to be neat and original, in context of colours as well as design. I really like the idea of social media link at the top right corner. The links are quite small which seems well arranged. The font of the website is also appealing to its design in context of colours as well as font. The arrangement of photographs is also really neat and well designed. I like the original idea of shadowy effect when a user hovers the mouse over a photo.</h3></div>

          <div><h2>Paravel design</h2>
        <h3>Parravel really piqued my attention in context of their professionalism. The way the text and photographs are laid out represents efficiency. It is visible that the designer is really experienced in his field. I also like the blurry effects which work, whenever a user is hovering his mouse over one of different options/links. I am also inspired by the footer which I am surely be taking ideas from.</h3></div>

            <div><h2>Stuff and Nonsense</h2>
        <h3>Stuff and nonsense gives a good first impression as all the pictures are well organised with the text.  Ease of use of website is an important element to keep trusted clients within the business. Every business is responsible in providing what clients require in order to progress to the next level. Companies should consider providing help to disabled users. Such as coloured blind users, users with sight problems and people over 60 years old.</h3></div>
